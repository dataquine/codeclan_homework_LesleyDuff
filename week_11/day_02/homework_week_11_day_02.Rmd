In this homework we will create a decision tree to see which factors are useful in predicting whether or not a passenger on the titanic will survive.

Run the code below before you begin:
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(tidyverse)

library(tidyverse)
titanic_set <- read_csv('data/titanic_decision_tree_data.csv')

shuffle_index <- sample(1:nrow(titanic_set))

# shuffle the data so class order isn't in order - need this for training/testing split later on 
titanic_set <- titanic_set[shuffle_index, ]
```
```{r}
titanic_set %>% 
  # skimr::skim() %>% View ()
glimpse() %>% 
  str()
```
