## Hypothesis testing - practical

You work for an animal conservation organisation and are looking to do some investigating into some of the animals to provide evidence for some projects you are looking to run. 

In this homework we'll use the `msleep` data set provided in the `ggplot` package. It concerns the sleeping patterns of various types of mammal.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(msleep)
```

**Question 1.**  
Explore the dataset and familiarise yourself with it.
